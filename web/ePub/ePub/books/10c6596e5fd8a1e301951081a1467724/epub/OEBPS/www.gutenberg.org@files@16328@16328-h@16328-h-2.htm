<div class="footnote" id="XXIV.FNDEF.1"><a href="www.gutenberg.org@files@16328@16328-h@16328-h-2.htm#XXIV.FNREF.1">[1]</a> ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">Þæs monige gewearð</span>’ (1599) and ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">hafað þæs geworden</span>’ (2027).—In a paper published some years ago in one of the Johns Hopkins University circulars, I tried to throw upon these two long-doubtful passages some light derived from a study of like passages in Alfred’s prose.—The impersonal verb ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">geweorðan</span>,’ with an accus. of the person, and a <span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæt</span>-clause is used several times with the meaning ‘agree.’ See Orosius (Sweet’s ed.) 178<sub>7</sub>; 204<sub>34</sub>; 208<sub>28</sub>; 210<sub>15</sub>; 280<sub>20</sub>. In the two Beowulf passages, the <span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæt</span>-clause is anticipated by ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæs</span>,’ which is clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.
<p>The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: <i>Then many agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him</i>.</p>
<p>The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): <i>She is promised …; to this the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc</i>. By emending ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">is</span>’ instead of ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">wæs</span>’ (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.</p>
<p>In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.’s great article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my reading of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: <i>Wouldst let the South-Danes themselves decide about their struggle with Grendel</i>. Here ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">Súð-Dene</span>’ is accus. of person, and ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">gúðe</span>’ is gen. of thing agreed on.</p>
<p>With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII. 97), I have no hesitation in departing from H.-So., my usual guide.</p>
<p>The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other Teutonic languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.</p>

B. emends and renders: <i>Nor was there any man in that desert who rejoiced in conflict, in battle-work.</i> That is, the hoard-ward could not find any one who had disturbed his slumbers, for no warrior was there, t.B.’s emendation would give substantially the same translation.</div>
