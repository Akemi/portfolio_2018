<p>Hrethrel had certainly never seen a son of his ride on the gallows to feed the crows.</p>
<p>The passage beginning ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">swá bið géomorlic</span>’ seems to be an effort to reach a full simile, ‘as … so.’ ‘As it is mournful for an old man, etc. … so the defence of the Weders (2463) bore heart-sorrow, etc.’ The verses 2451 to 2463½ would be parenthetical, the poet’s feelings being so strong as to interrupt the simile. The punctuation of the fourth edition would be better—a comma after ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">galgan</span>’ (2447). The translation may be indicated as follows: <i>(Just) as it is sad for an old man to see his son ride young on the gallows when he himself is uttering mournful measures, a sorrowful song, while his son hangs for a comfort to the raven, and he, old and infirm, cannot render him any kelp—(he is constantly reminded, etc., 2451-2463)—so the defence of the Weders, etc.</i></p>
