    <p class="first-indent">What kind of joke is this!? Asking us to meet at nine in the morning on a weekend! Despite that, though, I still pedaled hard on my bike towards the station. I’m so hopeless!</p>

    <p>Being located in the center of town, Kitaguchi Station acts as an important railway hub, and every weekend, the square in front of the station is packed with window-shopping youngsters. Apart from going to a larger city, there’s really not much to do in this town besides going to the mall near the station. It always amazes me how people can live normal lives in this town with so little to do.</p>

    <p>Randomly placing my bike at the closed entrance to the bank, I ran to the turnstiles on the north entrance of the station. It was still five minutes to nine, but everyone else had arrived.</p>

    <p>Haruhi turned her head and said.</p>

    <p>“You’re late! You’ve got to be fined!”</p>

    <p>“But it’s not nine yet.”</p>

    <p>“Even if you didn’t arrive late, the last person to arrive still has to be punished. That’s the rule!”</p>

    <p>“How come I never heard that rule before?”</p>

    <p>“Because I just thought it up!”</p>

    <p>Dressed in a long sleeved T-shirt and a short denim skirt, Haruhi looked very cheerful.</p>

    <p>“You’ll have to treat all of us to drinks.”</p>

    <p>Placing her arms on her waist with ease, Haruhi looked much more approachable than her usual scowling self. Unable to argue, I obligingly agreed to her command and led everyone to a nearby café.</p>

    <p>Asahina-san was dressed in a white sleeveless one-piece dress with a light blue knitted shirt on top. Her long wavy hair was clipped at the back of her head with a hair clip. Every time she moved, it would bounce slightly, making her look cute. Her smile gave her an impression of a well cultured cute young lady. Even her handbag looked trendy.</p>

    <p>Standing next to me, Koizumi wore a pink shirt with a jacket on top, as well as sporting a bright red necktie, making him look very formal. I was irritated but I had to admit he looked rather cool, plus he’s taller than me.</p>

    <p>Nagato, as usual, stood in the back wearing her sailor uniform. Even though she completely viewed herself as a member of the SOS Brigade, technically she was still with the Literature Club. Hearing her say all those strange things to me the other night made me even more concerned about her cool expression. By the way, why was she wearing a school uniform even on the weekends?</p>

    <p>As the Mystery Five walked into the café by the roundabout and sat down in our chairs, the waitress started taking our orders. Only Nagato studied the menu seriously - still no expression displayed, of course - taking her time to decide. Honestly, the time it took for her to decide on what to drink was enough to cook a bowl of ramen!</p>

    <p>“Almond tea.” She finally said.</p>

    <p>It doesn’t matter what you order, anyway, as I’m the one who’s paying.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">Haruhi made the following suggestions:</p>

    <p>We would split into two parties. If any of us were to find anything that looked mysterious we were to contact each other at once by cell phone then meet up to discuss what to do next. Once it was all over a debriefing would be held to review and prepare for further developments.</p>

    <p>That was all.</p>

    <p>“Now, let’s draw lots!”</p>

    <p>Haruhi took five toothpicks from the toothpick stand, then using a pen she borrowed from the waitress, she marked two of the toothpicks. She then wrapped her fingers around the toothpicks for us to draw.</p>

    <p>I drew a marked one; so did Asahina-san, who said while looking at her marked toothpick, “Hmm, what a combination, huh…”</p>

    <p>For some reason, Haruhi coldly glared at me and Asahina-san, and then yelled, “Kyon, you listen, this is not a date! Be serious, you understand?”</p>

    <p>“OK already!”</p>

    <p>Did I just show my thoughts to her? Nevertheless, this is great! I danced with joy inside as I saw Asahina-san stare at the marked toothpick blushing furiously. Oh yes!</p>

    <p>“What exactly are we looking for?” Koizumi asked nonchalantly, while Nagato drank her tea methodically.</p>

    <p>Finishing the last drop of iced coffee, Haruhi lightly flicked the hair behind her ears.</p>

    <p>“Anything that looks suspicious. Anything or anyone that looks funny. Also look for portals that can lead to a different dimensions and aliens disguised as humans.”</p>

    <p>I nearly spat out the mint tea I was drinking. That’s strange, why does Asahina-san have the same expression? Of course, Nagato remains the same as always.</p>

    <p>“I see.” Koizumi said.</p>

    <p>Are you sure you really understand?</p>

    <p>“So, all we need to do is to look for aliens, time travelers and espers with super-natural powers, and the traces they left behind on earth. I fully understand.” Koizumi said cheerfully.</p>

    <p>“That’s right! You really are a bright person, Koizumi-kun! It’s just like you said! Kyon, you should learn from him!”</p>

    <p>Stop feeding her ego! Annoyed, I looked at Koizumi who only smiled back at me and nodded.</p>

    <p>“Alright! Let’s go!”</p>

    <p>Haruhi shoved the bill at me and strode out of the café.</p>

    <p>Though I’ve said this many times, I’ve still got to say it:</p>

    <p>“Oh boy.”</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent"><em>Remember, this is not a date! If I find you going off to have fun with her, I’ll kill you!</em> So Haruhi said, going off with Koizumi and Nagato. We headed East and West respectively. I still don’t know what is it we’re supposed to look for.</p>

    <p>“What should we do?”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san looked at me, clutching her bag with her hands. I wanted to go home but knew it was impossible. So, I pretended to think for a while before saying, “It’s pointless just standing here, so let’s take a walk around.”</p>

    <p>“OK.”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san obligingly walked with me. She was hesitant when walking with me shoulder to shoulder. Every time when she accidentally bumped into my shoulder she would recoil shyly. She looked so innocent like that. We followed a path by the riverbank and aimlessly headed north. If we had come a month ago, we could’ve still enjoyed the blooming of cherry blossom trees, but now it’s just a plain riverside walk.</p>

    <p>As this is a popular spot for walking there are many families and couples walking along. If one didn’t know, they would think we’re a young couple, and not a group looking for something mysterious.</p>

    <p>Looking at the riverside, Asahina-san murmured softly to herself, “This is the first time I’ve had a walk like this!”</p>

    <p>“What do you mean?”</p>

    <p>“……That is, with a guy, just the two of us……”</p>

    <p>“That really surprises me. Could it be that you’ve never gone out with a guy before?”</p>

    <p>“No…”</p>

    <p>I turned towards Asahina-san whose soft hair was lightly fluttering in the wind and asked, “Wow! But there are plenty of guys who’ve confessed to you, right?”</p>

    <p>“Um…”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san shyly lowered her head. “But, it can’t work. I can’t involve myself in a relationship with anyone, at least not at this time…”</p>

    <p>She went quiet suddenly. As I waited for her to continue, three merry couples walked by.</p>

    <p>“Kyon-kun…”</p>

    <p>I was already counting the number of leaves that had fallen on the river when Asahina-san called to me.</p>

    <p>Asahina-san looked at me abashedly, and then, bracing herself, she said, “I have something to tell you.”</p>

    <p>Her round, deer-like eyes revealed her strong determination.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">We sat on a bench by the cherry blossom trees and for a long time Asahina-san didn’t speak. She lowered her head and muttered, “Where should I begin? I’m not good at explaining things. Maybe he won’t believe me.”</p>

    <p>Finally she lifted her head and started talking in a slightly embarrassed tone. “I’m not from this time and age. I am a person from the future. I can’t tell you when I arrived from, or from which temporal plane. I wouldn’t be able to anyway, even if I wanted to. Conveying any information regarding the future with any person from the past is strictly forbidden - and that’s why - before boarding the time machine I had to go through stringent mental conditioning. If I intended to say anything that shouldn’t be said, my memory concerning that information would be sealed.”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san took a deep breath and continued, “Unlike the water flowing in a river, every time frame is made up of different two-dimensional flat planes.”</p>

    <p>“You lost me from the beginning.”</p>

    <p>“Hmm, how about this, try to imagine it like a cartoon. When we’re watching a cartoon we see the characters within move seamlessly but, in fact, they’re all created from a series of still images. Similarly, time is like that, a digitized version. But if I use a series of still images as a description, maybe you’ll understand better.”</p>

    <p>“Between one time frame and another there are so-called temporal fault lines. They do exist, even though the frequency of the fault lines is near zero; so, there is no continuity between different time frames. Time traveling is the attempt to make a three-dimensional movement between the two-dimensional temporal planes. For me who has arrived from the future to this temporal plane, it is like adding an extra object, drawn onto the still image. Even if I attempted to change history in this age it would not affect the future, because there is no continuity between the time frames. Everything would stay in this temporal plane. It’s like trying to add a few words on a still image from hundreds of still images: the overall story wouldn’t be affected, right?”</p>

    <p>“Time is unlike this river here: every moment belongs to a digitized temporal plane. Are you following me now?”</p>

    <p>I hesitated on whether to place my hand on my forehead, which I eventually did. Temporal plane, digitized. These terms don’t matter to me, but, what’s with the time traveling?</p>

    <p>Asahina-san glanced at the toes on her sandals and continued, “Let me tell you the reason I’ve come to this temporal plane…”</p>

    <p>A couple with a young child passed by us at that moment.</p>

    <p>“Three years ago we detected the occurrence of a huge time-quake. Hmm, it should be around three years before today, just when Suzumiya-san entered junior high. We were shocked when we traveled back to investigate, because we were unable to travel any further into the past.”</p>

    <p>How come it’s three years ago again?</p>

    <p>“We came to a conclusion that there exists a massive temporal fault line, but we don’t know why it only appears at that specific time frame. It’s only recently that we discovered the reason…sorry, I meant recently for the age that I came from.”</p>

    <p>“…And why is that?”</p>

    <p>The culprit couldn’t be her, could it?</p>

    <p>“It’s because of Suzumiya-san.”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san said the words I didn’t want to hear.</p>

    <p>“She is located right at the center of the fourth dimension. Please don’t ask me why, since it’s forbidden, so I can’t tell you. However, we’re certain that it’s Suzumiya-san who has blocked the passage for traveling to the past.”</p>

    <p>“…I don’t think Haruhi is capable of such a thing…”</p>

    <p>“Neither did I. Honestly, it’s impossible for a normal human to interfere with the temporal planes. This is still an unsolved mystery, and Suzumiya-san herself is unaware that she is the source of all the temporal distortions and time-quakes. I came to Suzumiya-san’s side so that I could closely observe any new changes to the temporal planes…I’m sorry, I couldn’t find any better words to describe it, let’s just say I’m in charge of surveillance.”</p>

    <p>“……” I was too speechless to respond.</p>

    <p>“You don’t believe me, do you?”</p>

    <p>“No…right, so why are you telling me this?”</p>

    <p>“Because you have been chosen by Suzumiya-san.”</p>

    <p>Asahina turned and faced me,</p>

    <p>“I can’t go into the details. But, if I’ve guessed correctly, you are a very important person to Suzumiya-san. There is a reason for everything that she does.”</p>

    <p>“Then Nagato-san and Koizumi are…”</p>

    <p>“They are similar to me, but Suzumiya-san is still unaware that she is the one who has gathered us to her side.”</p>

    <p>“Then do you know what they are?”</p>

    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <img alt="" src="../Images/005.png" />

      <p class="caption">“Classified information~”</p>
    </div>

    <p>“That’s classified information.”</p>

    <p>“What would happen if we just leave Haruhi alone?”</p>

    <p>“Classified information.”</p>

    <p>“Since you’re from the future, you should know what happens next, right?”</p>

    <p>“Classified information.”</p>

    <p>“What if I told Haruhi all this?”</p>

    <p>“Classified information.”</p>

    <p>“…”</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry, I really can’t tell you. Especially right now, since I don’t have the right to do so.”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san said with an apologetic look on her face.</p>

    <p>“It doesn’t matter even if you don’t believe me; I’d just like to let you know about this.”</p>

    <p>I remember hearing the same things being said inside a dull, quiet apartment.</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

    <p>Seeing that I was silent, Asahina-san’s eyes look depressingly red.</p>

    <p>“I’m so sorry, for suddenly telling you all this.”</p>

    <p>“It’s okay, really……”</p>

    <p>First there’s Nagato telling me she’s a Living Humanoid Interface created by aliens, now there’s Asahina-san claiming she’s from the future. How am I supposed to believe that? Somebody, help me!</p>

    <p>When I placed my hand on the bench, I accidentally touched Asahina-san’s hand. Even though I only brushed her tiny fingers, Asahina-san retracted her fingers as fast as lightning, and lowered her head.</p>

    <p>We then silently stared at the river.</p>

    <p>Time passed by.</p>

    <p>“Asahina-san.”</p>

    <p>“Yes…?”</p>

    <p>“Can I pretend this conversation never happened? Whether I believe you or not, let’s put this aside for now.”</p>

    <p>“OK.”</p>

    <p>A smile came from Asahina-san’s face. It was a very beautiful smile.</p>

    <p>“As things go, this is the best solution. Please treat me as you have always done, I’m counting on you.”</p>

    <p>That said, Asahina-san bowed deeply to me. Hey, there’s no need to go so far!</p>

    <p>“Can I ask you one thing?”</p>

    <p>“What is it?”</p>

    <p>“Please tell me your real age.”</p>

    <p>“Classified information~”</p>

    <p>Asahina smiled naughtily.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">Afterwards, we took a stroll around the streets. Despite Haruhi’s pleas not to go on a date, I didn’t intend to follow them. We went window shopping at the fashion stores in the mall, merrily ate some ice cream, and had a look around the souvenir stalls by the street side……the typical things a couple would do to kill time. It would have been perfect if only we could hold each other’s hands…</p>

    <p>At this moment my cell phone rang: it was Haruhi.</p>

    <p>“We’ll meet at noon, at the station where we met this morning.”</p>

    <p>She hung up after saying that. I looked at my watch, and it was already eleven fifty. There’s no way we’re going to make it!</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">“Was it Suzumiya-san? What’d she say?”</p>

    <p>“She said we need to meet again at noon, so we’d better hurry!”</p>

    <p>I grabbed Asahina-san’s hand, knowing that we had no chance to make it by noon unless we ran, and we took off running towards the station. What reaction would Haruhi have, If she saw us running hand in hand? I wonder. I guess she’d go insane.</p>

    <p>“So, any results?” Haruhi questioned us, as we arrived.</p>

    <p>We were ten minutes late, and that was the first thing Haruhi said when she saw us. She seemed rather pissed.</p>

    <p>“Did you find anything?”</p>

    <p>“Nothing.”</p>

    <p>“Did you really even look? You didn’t just stroll around, did you? What about Mikuru-chan?”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san shook her head.</p>

    <p>“Then what have you guys found?”</p>

    <p>Haruhi went silent. Koizumi, standing behind her, scratched his head, while Nagato stood motionlessly.</p>

    <p>After a few moments of no one saying anything Haruhi nearly growled, “Let’s have lunch first then we’ll continue after that.”</p>

    <p>You still want to continue!?</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">As we had our lunch in a burger shop Haruhi said it was time to draw lots again, and drew out some extra toothpicks she’d nicked from the café earlier in the morning. She was really well prepared!</p>

    <p>Koizumi swiftly picked a toothpick.</p>

    <p>“Unmarked again.”</p>

    <p>Such white teeth! I always get the feeling this guy is always smiling!</p>

    <p>“So is mine.”</p>

    <p>Asahina-san showed me the toothpick she just drawn.</p>

    <p>“What about Kyon-kun?”</p>

    <p>“Sadly, mine is marked.”</p>

    <p>Haruhi seemed to get more and more moody and rushed Nagato into drawing a toothpick.</p>

    <p>In the end, Nagato and I were grouped together, while the other three were in the other group.</p>

    <p>“…”</p>

    <p>Haruhi glared at the unmarked toothpick as if staring at the person who killed her father, then turned towards me and Nagato, who was busy eating her cheeseburger, and scowled.</p>

    <p>Why are you so mad?</p>

    <p>“We’ll meet in front of the station by four. Be sure to find something by then!”</p>

    <p>She finished her drink in one gulp, after saying that.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">This time we went South and North, with my group in charge of the south side. Before we parted, Asahina-san waved one of her little hands at me. It made me feel so warm!</p>

    <p>Now it was just me and Nagato standing idly in front of the busy station.</p>

    <p>“What should we do?”</p>

    <p>“……” Nagato said nothing.</p>

    <p>“…Let’s go.”</p>

    <p>I strode forward, and found that she started following. It seems I’m beginning to get used to hanging out with her now.</p>

    <p>“Nagato, about the stuff you told me the other day…”</p>

    <p>“What about it?”</p>

    <p>“I’m starting to believe it a little.”</p>

    <p>“Is that so?”</p>

    <p>“Yeah.”</p>

    <p>“……”</p>

    <p>So under this empty atmosphere we silently walked around the station.</p>

    <p>“Don’t you have any casual clothing?”</p>

    <p>“……”</p>

    <p>“What do you do on holidays?”</p>

    <p>“……”</p>

    <p>“Are you happy now?”</p>

    <p>“……”</p>

    <p>That’s how our conversation went for that day.</p>

    <p>There was no point walking around aimlessly so I took Nagato to a new library by the seaside that was built at the same time the authorities developed the land for the station. I’d never been inside before, as I rarely borrowed any books. However, I thought I could get some rest when we got inside, only to discover that every seat was occupied. These people probably also have nowhere else to go in their free time. I glanced around the library, looking a bit lost, while Nagato had already drifted towards the bookshelves like she was sleep walking. Let her do what she likes!</p>

    <p>I used to read often. When I was in elementary school, my mom used to borrow illustrated books from the children’s book section for me to read. There were all sorts of books, but I remember that all the ones I’d read were quite interesting. However, I can’t remember any of their names anymore. When did I stop reading? When did reading start becoming boring for me?</p>

    <p>I randomly picked up a book from the bookshelf and quickly flipped through a few pages, before putting it back and then picking up another book. It would take me forever to find an interesting book in this sea of books, if I didn’t do any research. Thinking like that, I wandered between the bookshelves, aimlessly.</p>

    <p>As I headed to look for Nagato, I found her reading in front of a bookshelf of thick hardback books. She really does love thick hardback books!</p>

    <p>Finally, after seeing a man reading his newspaper get up from his chair, I went and sat down, carrying a novel that I had randomly picked. It’s impossible trying to read a book I never intended on reading. A while later, I found myself getting drowsy, and fell asleep.</p>

    <p>At that moment my hip pocket suddenly vibrated.</p>

    <p>“WHOA!?”</p>

    <p>I jumped in astonishment. When I saw everyone frowning at me, I remembered that I was in a library. Wiping the drool off my face I rushed out of the library and answered my cell phone, which was set to vibration mode.</p>

    <p>“You idiot! What have you been doing!?”</p>

    <p>A deafening sound roared through my ear. Thanks to this I awoke from my drowsiness.</p>

    <p>“What time do you think it is now?”</p>

    <p>“Sorry, I just woke up just now!”</p>

    <p>“What!? You dumbass!”</p>

    <p>You are the least qualified to call me a dumbass!</p>

    <p>I looked at my watch and it was past half past four. She said we were to meet at four!</p>

    <p>“Get your asses over here at once! I give you thirty seconds!”</p>

    <p>Stop making demands that are impossible to achieve!</p>

    <p>After Haruhi roughly hung-up the phone I placed my phone back in my pocket and returned to the library. There I found Nagato still standing there, reading what seemed like a thick encyclopedia.</p>

    <p>The following was a bit tricky. It took quite some time trying to move Nagato - who seemed rooted to the spot - and then we had to go to the counter to fill in a form to borrow the book. During that time I ignored all of Haruhi’s phone calls.</p>

    <p>When we returned to the station, with Nagato carrying a thick philosophical book like a well-treasured item, written by some foreign author whose name was very hard to pronounce, the three people waiting there all had different reactions. Asahina-san, looking exhausted, smiled with a sigh of relief; Koizumi shrugged his shoulders like an idiot; while Haruhi yelled as though she’d just drank some cold soup.</p>

    <p>“You’re late; pay the fine!”</p>

    <p>Do I have to treat you guys again?</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="first-indent">Finally, we ended today’s outdoor activity, after wasting our time and my money.</p>

    <p>“I’m so tired! Suzumiya-san walked so fast that I had a tough time keeping up.” Asahina-san told me as we parted, and then she whispered in my ear, “Thanks for listening to what I said today.” She then lowered her head and smiled shyly.</p>

    <p>Do people from the future all smile so elegantly?</p>

    <p>“Then, see you!” Asahina-san waved goodbye and left. Koizumi softly patted my shoulder and said, “That was fun today! How should I say this? Suzumiya-san really is an interesting person. It’s a pity I couldn’t be with you today, perhaps next time.”</p>

    <p>After Koizumi left with that annoying grin of his, I discovered Nagato had left already.</p>

    <p>That left Haruhi staring at me.</p>

    <p>“What have you been doing all day today?”</p>

    <p>“Hmm, what have I been doing today?”</p>

    <p>“You can’t go on like that!”</p>

    <p>Looks like she’s really pissed.</p>

    <p>“Oh yeah, what about you? You found anything interesting?”</p>

    <p>Haruhi bit her lip and said nothing. If I didn’t stop her she would bite it until her lips bled.</p>

    <p>“Well, it’s not like they’d be so careless as to let you discover them in one day.”</p>

    <p>Seeing me trying to lighten the mood Haruhi turned her eyes away quickly.</p>

    <p>“We’ll have a debriefing the day after tomorrow, in school.”</p>

    <p>Haruhi turned and walked into the crowd, without looking back.</p>

    <p>With the thought of finally being able to go home, I returned to the bank, only to discover my bike was missing. Replacing it was a sign on the lamppost saying, “Your bicycle has been towed away as a result of illegal parking.”</p>
